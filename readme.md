# PRAVEEN RAI

#### This is my third project of tailwind, this project tought me a lot about to tailwind as tailwind is the framework of css. It was very challenging as I was using tailwind for the first time.

- `You write less custom CSS`
- `You keep CSS files small`
- `You don't have to invent class names`

#### It took 1day to complete this project
